        The Enterprise is a 70ft canal boat with a ramp and wheelchair lift,
        seating for up to 12 people, and large front deck with seating, a small
        kitchen, central heating, toilet and picture windows allowing for a full
        view of the surroundings. We operate trips from Hatherton Marina to
        Coven (The Fox and Anchor or the Three Hammers golf complex) or to
        Autherley Junction for a slightly longer trip. Food can either be
        brought yourselves, we can get fish and chips on the way, or you can
        stop at the pub or the golf complex for a full meal with drinks.
        <TextContainer>
          We aim to provide affordable day trips on the canals for community
          groups and families with members who are elderly, disabled, unwell or
          disadvantaged.
